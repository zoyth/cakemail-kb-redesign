# Set up timezone and regional preferences for global teams

## Overview

Proper timezone and regional configuration ensures your email campaigns reach subscribers at optimal times and display information correctly across different markets. This guide covers setting up timezone preferences, regional formatting, and managing global campaign scheduling effectively.

## Prerequisites

- Active Cakemail account with administrative access
- Understanding of your primary business timezone
- Knowledge of target audience geographic locations
- List of team members' locations (if managing global teams)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Access Regional Settings

1. **Log into your Cakemail account** as an administrator
2. **Click on your account name** in the top-right corner
3. **Select "Account Settings" or "Preferences"** from the dropdown
4. **Navigate to "Regional Settings" or "Timezone"** section
5. **You'll see the current timezone and regional configuration**

### 2. Configure Primary Timezone

1. **Select your primary business timezone** from the dropdown menu
   - Choose the timezone where your business is headquartered
   - This affects default campaign scheduling
   - All timestamps in the interface will display in this timezone

2. **Enable automatic daylight saving time adjustment** if applicable
   - Recommended for most users
   - Automatically adjusts for DST transitions
   - Ensures accurate scheduling year-round

3. **Set default campaign scheduling timezone**
   - Can be different from account timezone
   - Useful for targeting specific markets
   - Override on per-campaign basis when needed

### 3. Configure Regional Formatting

1. **Date Format Settings**
   - Choose between MM/DD/YYYY (US), DD/MM/YYYY (International), or YYYY-MM-DD (ISO)
   - This affects how dates appear in campaigns and reports
   - Consider your primary audience's expectations

2. **Time Format Configuration**
   - Select 12-hour (AM/PM) or 24-hour format
   - Affects campaign scheduling interface
   - Choose based on team and audience preferences

3. **Number and Currency Formatting**
   - Set decimal separators (period or comma)
   - Choose thousands separators
   - Configure currency symbols and positioning
   - Important for international campaigns with pricing

### 4. Set Up Team Member Timezone Preferences

1. **Navigate to team member management**
2. **Edit individual user profiles**
3. **Allow team members to set personal timezones**
   - Helps with collaboration across time zones
   - Each user sees times in their preferred zone
   - Scheduling remains in account default timezone

4. **Configure timezone display preferences**
   - Show both local and account timezone
   - Enable timezone conversion tooltips
   - Set up timezone abbreviations for clarity

### 5. Campaign Scheduling Considerations

1. **Set default send times** for different regions
   - Morning sends for different timezones
   - Optimal engagement windows by region
   - Consider business hours vs. personal email checking

2. **Configure automated scheduling rules**
   - Prevent sends during off-hours
   - Set up holiday scheduling restrictions
   - Create regional blackout periods

3. **Enable timezone-aware automation**
   - Automation triggers respect subscriber timezones
   - Welcome emails send at appropriate local times
   - Drip campaigns follow local schedules

## Best Practices

**Global Campaign Strategy:**
- Research optimal send times for each target region
